                My name is Sandy Sundram. I was born on an airforce base in southern India and was raised in Bombay. I currently live in the El Cerrito hills with my wife Nicola.
                <br>I have a bachelors degree in computer enineering from Purdue university. I am currently in sotware quality assurance and lead of team of quality engineers. I have over 14 years of work experience, covering multiple roles within the SDLC - developer, business analyst and project manager.
                <br>Outside of work, I like the outdoors, sports and any physical activity. I live for travel, enjoy nature photography and pass time tinkering with my car. Strangely enough, I recently have got into, and enjoy gardening with my wife (who would have thouht??).
